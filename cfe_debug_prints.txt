NDCK - apply the NAND phase bump patch
NONE - jffs2 magic not found in partition
NAN6 - NVRAM_DATA fields for this rootfs are not valid
NAN7 - File system info cannot be found for either rootfs. NVRAM_DATA may not be set. Use default values.
NAN8 - cfe_launch(pucEntry) failed or (pucEntry && isize <= 0) == FALSE
PAR0 (PARx) - searching partition (x)
U000 (Uxxx) - successfully retrieved UBIFS sequence number (xxx)
COM0 - copy of UBIFS metadata is uncommitted
COM1 - copy of UBIFS metadata is committed
UBI# - end of UBI processing
BTxx (BT00 -> 0000) - position of bootblock (stored in nvram)
NAN9 - bootblock position is not stored in NVRAM
JFFS - NAND_FULL_PARTITION_SEARCH is done
J000 (J###) - search for cferam.###
OVRD - software debug is on, boot priority override
TRYx (TRY0) - searching partition for CFERAM
NAN3 - beginning of partition search
JFS2 - NVRAM says boot partition is JFFS2
RFSx (RFS0 -> JFFS) - If secure boot, compressed, encrypted CFE RAM is authenticated within internal memory
ERR1 - nand_read_buf() <= 0 (end of flash or read error)
UBI! - process UBI load (also if jffs2 not found)
BTL? -> BTLA -> PASS - Authenticate the CFE RAM bootloader (boot_secure)
NAN5 - Save the rootfs partition that the CFE RAM image boots from at the memory location before the CFE RAM load address. The CFE RAM image uses this value to determine the partition to flash a new rootfs to.
DIE0 - cferam is not found, cleanup internal memory, and set the external interface enable bit high enabling JTAG access
LINX - directly start linux from ROM
CMPF - decompression Failed
PLLI - pll_init() starting
PMCB - WaitPmc(kPMCRunStateAVSCompleteWaitingForImage) finished
ERRA - The expected message is larger than we can sign using SHA-256
ERRB - The signature block provided is the wrong size
ERRC - The SHA-256 digest we were passed was the wrong size
ERRD - The public key modulus provided is the wrong size
ERRE - The encoded message is too small to hold the required information
ERRF - The seed length is not the length of a SHA-256 digest
ERRG - An MP division operation has failed
ERRH - We cannot generate a mask of the requested length
ERRI - The message representative is too short to hold the required information 
ERRJ - The message representative did not end with the required byte 0xbc
ERRK - The recovered message MB' is not null (but should have been)
ERRL - The computed hash does not match the recovered hash
ERRM - UNKNOWN SHA-256 error
MMU0 - armv8_mmuinit()
MER0 - armv8_mmuinit()
DRE0 - DRAM test error
PASS - DRAM test pass
DRAM - DDR init
SIZx (SIZ0) - memory size detect (x+1 for each 2gb)
SIZX -> FAIL - memory size cannot be detected
CKLP - GPIO check loop
PMCE - PMC error
PMCD - PMC done
